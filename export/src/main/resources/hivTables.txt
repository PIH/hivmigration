# DOUBLE CHECK WITH LOUISE ON THIS, BUT I BELIEVE THIS IS NO LONGER NEEDED. SIMPLY KEEPS TRACK OF WHICH PATIENTS ARE ANLAP AND WHAT GROUP THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO

HIV_ERRORS
HIV_MESSAGES

# TABLE THAT KEEPS TRACK OF WHAT DATA QUALITY LISTS PATIENTS ARE SHOWING UP ON, AND ENABLES REMOVING THEM FROM THOSE LISTS AFTER REVIEW.  RECOMMEND NOT TO MIGRATE.

# TABLE THAT KEEPS TRACK OF HISTORICAL REPORT EVALUATIONS AND ALLOWS FOR DOWNLOADING THE RESULTS
